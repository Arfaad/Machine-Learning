Aim: To develop a Python-based web scraping script to extract hotel information (name, price, and rating) from the OYO Rooms website for Bangalore and save the data into a CSV file.


Algorithm:
* Import required libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup, csv, time, and logging.
* Identify the URL pattern for pagination.
* Send an HTTP GET request to the target page.
* Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
* Locate relevant HTML tags and classes for hotel name, price, and rating. 
* Extract and clean the data.
* Use default values ("No Name", "No Price", "No Rating") if specific fields are unavailable.
* Write the extracted data to a CSV file with headers.
* Repeat the process for multiple pages with pagination.
* Introduce a delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the server.
* Log successes and failures for each page.
* Save and review the CSV file.
